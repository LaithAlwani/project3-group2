## Description
Have you ever been apart of a sports team and forgot practice time or a game ? 

We are introducing the Management system web-app which allows a manager or coach to post, communicate and/or share resources within the private group  so its members can easily access the group content. The coach can add members so they can be updated daily with information. 


This app allows a user to maintain their sports teams. The users can add their teams. When a team is created by that user, that users is able to:
* Add / remove team members/ players.
* Add/ remove post made in by that team.(All team members can add a post).
* Delete the team.

### User Story:
```
As the coach of a sports team I would like to 
schedule practice times, post workout videos and send helpful links to the players on my team 
so that they can improve their skills.
```

## Usage
The user is able to sign up and log into the application. The application has a password forget and reset feature for users who need to reset their password. The user will receive an email with a reset token that allows them to reset the password.

Once the user logs in, they have the option the view their profiles and see their teams. If the user opts to view their profiles, they have are able to upload a profile image. The user needs to ensure that the file they want to uplad is an image file with the appropriate extension and naming convention. The user is also able to update their informtion (username , password and email).

If the users opts to view their teams, they are re-directed to the teams page. The user can create/add their team. The user that creates a team becomes the team admin. As the team admin, the user is able to add and delete players/ team members. The team admin is able to update the team information as well as delete the team. All members that are added to the team are able to post and view information the that team group. The team admim is the only member of the team that can delete posts as well.
